# react-with-vite-storybook-demo
A demo of React with Vite and Storybook

Vite is an alternative to CRA (Create-React-App). The challenges with CRA is that it is built with wepack and babel under the hood. Vite uses ESBuild which is faster.

CRA has been used to build React projects but it has now become clunkier than the options out there, like Vite. It is more difficult working with TypeScript, creating a production-ready app and updates of the internals (webpack/ babel and others) can be buggy.
