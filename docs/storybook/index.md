# How Storybook v7 works with React and Vite

Storybook is a UI (user interface) Catalog that helps developers, designers and stakeholders collaborate on brand and other UI imperatives.

Instead of developing and reviewing with stakeholders, you can create the UI and get your stakeholder feedback before developing the app frontend.

A modular, component driven design structure helps you build a hierarchy of elements that can be used to create complex UI based on simple building blocks - like a button, or a card, or page dividers, for example.

Atomic design - using scientific terms to breakdown this hierarchy of UI into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and finally pages.

UI components and pages can be built in isolation from the main app and helps develop and share design versions and test edge cases without the need to build, test and run the whole app for the team to see the output.

The docs give you a good explaination of [why you should use Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/why-storybook).

The package ships with config files in the `/.storybook` folder and some sample stories to browse.
