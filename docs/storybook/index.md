# How Storybook v7 works with React and Vite

To scaffold cd (change directories) into storybook-demo and install the packages with the script `npx storybook@latest init`

Accept ES Lint config and note that the packages take a little while to install.

You can run the script `npm run storybook`` now to see the files.

The package ships with demo files that you can tinker with. Import the `Button` story into your main app to see how the component that ships with the Storybook package works.
