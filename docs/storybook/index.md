# How Storybook v7 works with React and Vite

Storybook is a UI (user interface) Catalog that helps developers, designers and stakeholders collaborate on brand and other UI imperatives.

Instead of developing and reviewing with stakeholders, you can create the UI and get your stakeholder feedback before developing the app frontend.

A modular, component driven design structure helps you build a hierarchy of elements that can be used to create complex UI based on simple building blocks - like a button, or a card, or page dividers, for example.

Atomic design - using scientific terms to breakdown this hierarchy of UI into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and finally pages.
