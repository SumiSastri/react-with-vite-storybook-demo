# Chakra v2 with React 19 and Storybook v7

Chakra is a UI (user interface) tool that currently (Nov 2023) has a major version release. 

While Chakra v1 is compatible with React 17. Chakra v2 works with React v18 and higher.

Chakra creates prefabricated UI components that you can import into a React app, or any framework using React under the hood. This makes designing and prototyping quick. The downside is you lose flexibility. However, you can build your own custom theme or use styled-CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is CSS in JavaScript, in surrounding `<div/>` tags.
