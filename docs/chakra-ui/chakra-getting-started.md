# Demos of Chakra components with React

Chakra documentation is very easy to follow - this section provides some useful sections of the documentation to review. See the scaffolding section to add Chakra to the app. I have mainly followed the docs to create demos or the [NetNinja Chakra Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hcnIeryurNMMcGBHp7AYlP)

- [Design Principles Docs](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/principles)
- Colors are notated slightly differently see docs for [default theme](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/theme)

- [Style props docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props)
- [The sx prop docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/the-sx-prop)
- [Icon package docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/icon/usage). Chakra icons need to be installed but makes compatibility of your icons library (of which there are several - fontawesome is popular) higher and may be a better option to consider.
- [Responsive styles](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/responsive-styles)

- [Flex layouts](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/flex/usage)
- [Grid layouts](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/grid) 
- [Simple grid layout](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/simple-grid)

- [Card Component docs](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/card/usage) - basic and advanced composition, useful to review the [NetNinja tute on the Chakra Card Component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pExAE289j9s&t=256s)

- [Forms - basic no logic](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/form-control/usage) The ui for forms uses specific components see docs and demo. See Create page for forms  with logic and form submission with data.

- [Tabs docs](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/tabs/usage) Tab is the wrapper, the TabList is the panels and TabPanels are the content that are related to the TabList. The order of placement is important - each TabList is related to a TabPanel.

- [The hooks section](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-boolean) which starts with the `useBoolean` hook and then lists all the other hooks you can use below.
