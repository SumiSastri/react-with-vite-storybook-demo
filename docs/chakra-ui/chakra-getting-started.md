# Chakra getting started

Chakra documentation is very easy to follow - this section provides some useful sections of the documentation to review. See the scaffolding section to add Chakra to the app.

- [Design Principles Docs](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started/principles)

- [Style props docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props)
- [The sx prop docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/the-sx-prop)

- [Icon package docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/icon/usage). Chakra icons need to be installed but makes compatibility of your icons library (of which there are several - fontawesome is popular) higher and may be a better option to consider.

- [Flex layouts](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/flex/usage)

- [Grid layouts](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/grid) 
- [Simple grid layout](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/simple-grid)

- [Responsive styles](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/responsive-styles)

- [Card Component docs](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/card/usage) - basic and advanced composition, useful to review the [NetNinja tute on the Chakra Card Component](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pExAE289j9s&t=256s)

- [The hooks section](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-boolean) which starts with the `useBoolean` hook and then lists all the other hooks you can use below.

- Colors are notated slightly differently see docs for [default theme](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/theme)

- Responsive Styles -
